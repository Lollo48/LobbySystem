<h4 align="center"> Overview </h4>
This project involves the development of a robust multiplayer infrastructure for a PvP game in Unity, leveraging Unity Lobby and Unity Relay services. The system supports creation, management, discovery, and participation in multiplayer lobbies with peer-to-peer matchmaking, host migration, ban/kick functionality, public/private lobbies, and secure match start via Relay join codes.

<h4 align="center"> Game Design Features </h4>
Lobby System

Creation of public/private lobbies
Join by ID or private code
List available lobbies (filtered by slots)
Real-time state updates (polling)
Game start by host command
Player list visualization and host-based kick/ban
Track of banned people

Relay System

Secure Relay Allocation (host)
The host creates an "allocation" on the Unity Relay service: this is a temporary reservation of slots for players, protected by access keys, allowing secure connections even behind NAT/firewalls. 
Join via JoinCode (client)
Clients connect using a Join Code (an alphanumeric code generated by the host via Relay): this code alone is enough to join the match, with no need to know IP addresses or ports. 
Temporary Relay Allocations Linked to Lobbies
Each Relay allocation is temporary and linked to a specific multiplayer lobby: when the match ends, the allocation is released and players are automatically disconnected. 

Host Migration

If the host leaves, the role is automatically passed to the next player
Lobby is updated and clients are notified

Custom Lobby Data

GameMode, Map, Player Level, RelayCode, BannedPlayers (all serialized for each lobby)

GameLobbyManager: Central singleton, connects UI, lobby, and relay systems
MyLobbyManager: Handles lobby logic and Unity Services interface
MyRelayManager: Manages Relay allocations/join codes and network setup
