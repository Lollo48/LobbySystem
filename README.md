## 📝 Overview Overview 
This project involves the development of a robust multiplayer infrastructure for a PvP game in Unity, leveraging Unity Lobby and Unity Relay services. The system supports creation, management, discovery, and participation in multiplayer lobbies with peer-to-peer matchmaking, host migration, ban/kick functionality, public/private lobbies, and secure match start via Relay join codes.

## 🚀 Game Engine, Plug-ins, SDK

> - Unity 6000.1.4f1 or newer  
> - Packages:  
>   - `com.unity.services.lobby`  
>   - `com.unity.services.relay`  
>   - `com.unity.netcode.gameobjects`  
>   - `com.unity.transport`  
>   - `com.unity.services.authentication`

## 🧩 Unity Lobby Plugin – Explanation & Workflow

Unity Lobby is a first-party multiplayer service that provides all the necessary tools to create, manage, and join multiplayer game lobbies. It lays the foundation for matchmaking, session management, and real-time coordination between players before the actual gameplay begins.

### With Unity Lobby, you can easily support:

- Public and private lobbies

- Player metadata (names, levels, etc.)

- Custom lobby data (game mode, map, player level, etc.)

- Player list visualization

- Kick/ban and host migration logic

## ⚙️ How Does the Plugin Work? – Quick Start

1 - Navigate to Prefabs/LobbySystem in your project folder.

2 - Drag and drop the required Lobby System prefabs into your scene.

3 - Press “Play” in the Unity Editor.

4 - Enjoy the complete multiplayer lobby system out of the box!

## 🎮 Game Features
### Lobby System

Creation of public/private lobbies
Join by ID or private code
List available lobbies (filtered by slots)
Real-time state updates (polling)
Game start by host command
Player list visualization and host-based kick/ban
Track of banned people

### Relay System

Secure Relay Allocation (host)
The host creates an "allocation" on the Unity Relay service: this is a temporary reservation of slots for players, protected by access keys, allowing secure connections even behind NAT/firewalls. 
Join via JoinCode (client)
Clients connect using a Join Code (an alphanumeric code generated by the host via Relay): this code alone is enough to join the match, with no need to know IP addresses or ports. 
Temporary Relay Allocations Linked to Lobbies
Each Relay allocation is temporary and linked to a specific multiplayer lobby: when the match ends, the allocation is released and players are automatically disconnected. 

### Host Migration

If the host leaves, the role is automatically passed to the next player
Lobby is updated and clients are notified

### Custom Lobby Data

GameMode, Map, Player Level, RelayCode, BannedPlayers (all serialized for each lobby)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

GameLobbyManager: Central singleton, connects UI, lobby, and relay systems.

MyLobbyManager: Handles lobby logic and Unity Services interface.

MyRelayManager: Manages Relay allocations/join codes and network setup.

## 💡 Features Roadmap

- [x] Lobby creation/joining with host migration
- [x] Secure Relay session management
- [x] Ban/kick management with serialization
- [x] Custom lobby data (game mode, map, level, etc.)
- [ ] **Coming soon:** Character customization before game start
- [ ] **Coming soon:** Playable shared scene for all players once host starts the match
- [ ] **Coming soon:**: Dynamic modification of lobby parameters after creation (game mode, map, player limit)
